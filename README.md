# Docker

##### Images versus containers

An image is the binaries, the libraries and source codes that make up the application. An image is the application we want to run. A container is an instance of that image running as a process.

Docker’s default image “registry” is called Docker Hub (hub.docker.com). Registries are like what GitHub is to source code.
